# Compliment Machine

This webapp lightens up your day by casually complimenting you when you walk by a computer.

## How does it work

The webapp itself uses HTML5 video to accept input from the webcam. It processes this video (in a rather rudimentary way) to detect motion. When it detects motion, it uses the `Audio` object to play a compliment from a list of several audio files.

## Compliment audio files

Currently, the compliment audio files were generated by a simple script that I ran on Mac OS X (in order to utilize the built-in speech synthesizer.) The 13 compliments were from a website for which I cannot remember the URL.

## Idea

The idea was conceived by a friend of mine, Josh Fishman. I feel bad for not including him in this implementation, but I justify it by saying that I coded this just for fun. What is code if not fun and games?
